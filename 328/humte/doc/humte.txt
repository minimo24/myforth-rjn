-----[OVERVIEW]-----

The HUMTE project demonstrates how to extend the ENDIS encoder
and display demo with a DHT22 temperature and humdity sensor. 

The finished project provides a standalone temperature & humidity
display on the Nokia graphics LCD display.  The incemental encoder
is also active and used to determine whether degrees are displayed in
Celsius or Fahrenheit.  The project was cloned from the ENDIS demo.

-----[DESCRIPTION]-----

The demo shows how to integrate a temperature and humidity sensor
into an existing myforth-arduino project.  It is primarily designed to use
the Nokia display but words are available so that the temperature and
humidity can be read out in the serial command mode when the NOKIA
project board's option jumper is configured in the "cmd" mode.

-----[ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ]-----

1. NOKIA project board with an incremental encoder and a DHT22 
   temperature/humidity sensor.
2. A PC running a terminal program at 57K baud such as minicom.
3. A Textronix TDS2014 oscilloscope.

-----[ HARDWARE ]-----

Same as given above for the Development Environment. 

-----[ SOFTWARE ]-----

1. The ENDIS application was used as a template with the updated ie_1.fs 
   encoder driver and init.fs changed to configure the two. 
2. The standalone interpreter was used to troubleshoot
   the demo.
3. See init.fs for pin configuration, job.fs for application load file.

-----[ DOCUMENTATION ]-----

The documentation is now provided in the "doc" directory (e.g., humte.html).
